Privacy Policy – Fynex Music Bot

# Overview

Fynex is a Discord music bot made for fun and entertainment. It lets you play music in your server’s voice channels and enjoy songs with your community.
We respect your privacy and want you to know that Fynex does not collect or misuse your personal information.

# Data We Collect

To make the bot work properly, Fynex only collects very limited information:

- User IDs & Server IDs – to identify which server and which user is using the bot.

- Command messages (like !play song) – these are only processed for a few seconds to play music. We do not store them permanently.

- Voice channel details – so the bot knows where to join and play music.

That’s it. No sensitive information (like your email, password, or phone number) is collected.

# Data Retention & Security

All data is temporary and is deleted once it’s no longer needed.

We do not keep permanent records of your activity.

Basic security practices are followed to make sure your data is safe.



---

# Children’s Privacy

Discord already requires users to be 13 years or older. Fynex follows the same rule.
If we ever come to know that data from someone under 13 is collected, we will delete it immediately.

# Bot Usage Rules

Please use Fynex responsibly (no spamming or breaking Discord’s rules).

Playing illegal or copyrighted content in a harmful way is not allowed.

By using Fynex, you agree to follow this Privacy Policy and Discord’s Terms of Service.



---

# Third Party Services

Fynex may connect to third-party services like YouTube, Spotify, or SoundCloud to fetch music.
These platforms have their own Privacy Policies. When you use Fynex, you are also agreeing to follow their rules.


---

# Data Sharing

Fynex does not sell, share, or trade your data with anyone.

Data is only processed internally to run the bot smoothly.



---

# Data Security

Since we only collect minimum data, the risk is already very low.

Still, we ensure the bot follows standard Discord API security practices.



---

# Updates to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated in the future if needed.
Whenever we make changes, the latest version will always be available publicly (on GitHub or our official links).
